{
  "username": {
    "password": "$2y$10$...",
    "email": "user@example.com",
    "first_name": "John",
    "last_name": "Doe",
    "account_host": "Lab Name",

    },
    "role": "user|admin"

NOTES:
- Admin users have role="admin", empty access []
- Regular users have role="user", must have >= 1 assembly
- access is organism → assembly array mapping

=============================================================================
ADMIN TOOLS STATUS - COMPLETE OVERVIEW
=============================================================================

COMPLETED & PRODUCTION-READY:
  ✅ manage_organisms.php - Full clean architecture (tested)
  ✅ manage_groups.php - Full clean architecture (tested)
  ✅ manage_users.php - Full clean architecture (tested today)
  ✅ error_log.php - Clean architecture
  ✅ filesystem_permissions.php - Enhanced with subdirectory checks (tested)

PARTIALLY REFACTORED:
  ⏳ manage_annotations.php - Wrapper & content split, needs verification

NOT YET REFACTORED:
  [ ] manage_registry.php - ~400 lines
  [ ] manage_taxonomy_tree.php - ~400 lines
  [ ] manage_site_config.php - 1074 lines (defer - very complex)
  [ ] admin.php - Dashboard (do last)
  [ ] convert_groups.php - Legacy tool
  [ ] debug_permissions.php - Already exists

=============================================================================
NEXT PHASE - PRIORITY ORDER
=============================================================================

PHASE 2 (Immediate - ~1-2 hours each):
  1. manage_annotations.php - Verify partial refactoring, complete if needed
  2. manage_registry.php - Analyze and refactor
  3. manage_taxonomy_tree.php - Analyze and refactor

PHASE 3 (Deferred - Complex):
  4. manage_site_config.php - Large refactoring (1074 lines, multiple sections)

PHASE 4 (Final):
  5. admin.php - Dashboard (depends on all others working)

FUTURE:
  - Public page conversion to clean architecture
  - Full system testing
  - Performance optimization
  - Bulk operations and audit logging

=============================================================================
USERS.JSON BACKUP STATUS
=============================================================================

Created backups at multiple checkpoints during refactoring:
- manage_users.php.bak2 - Pre-redesign state
- manage_users.phpBAK - Earlier state

All operations tested and validated before proceeding.

=============================================================================
COMMIT SUMMARY (This Extended Session)
=============================================================================

Multiple commits made to track progress:
- manage_users complete redesign
- System permissions enhancements
- Assembly management improvements
- Search functionality restoration
- Code cleanup

All commits are incremental and reversible if needed.

=============================================================================
KNOWN LIMITATIONS & FUTURE IMPROVEMENTS
=============================================================================

1. Password Security
   - Passwords visible in form (consider: masked input)
   - Consider: Password strength validation
   - Consider: Show/hide toggle

2. Bulk Operations
   - Could add: "Grant organism X to all users"
   - Could add: "Remove organism X from all users"
   - Could add: "Bulk create users" (CSV import)

3. UI Enhancements
   - Could add: Tooltips on each field
   - Could add: Confirmation dialogs
   - Could add: Recent users list

4. Audit Trail
   - Could add: Log of user modifications
   - Could add: Who edited, when, what changed

5. Export/Import
   - Could add: Export users as CSV
   - Could add: Bulk import

=============================================================================
NEXT SESSION - QUICK START
=============================================================================

To continue, you have 3 options:

OPTION 1: Complete manage_annotations.php
   - It's already partially refactored
   - Just needs verification and any final tweaks
   - Fastest path (highest priority)

OPTION 2: Start manage_registry.php
   - Medium complexity
   - ~400 lines, no UI split yet
   - Similar refactoring pattern to previous tools

OPTION 3: Start manage_taxonomy_tree.php
   - Medium complexity
   - ~400 lines, likely hierarchical UI
   - May have special UI considerations

AVOID FOR NOW:
   - manage_site_config.php is too complex to rush
   - admin.php should be done last

All the refactored admin tools follow the same clean architecture pattern:
1. Wrapper processes POST data
2. Content file in pages/ handles UI/display
3. JavaScript module handles interactions
4. Universal patterns (collapse handler, etc.) already established

  3. manage_site_config.php - 1074 lines (complex - lower priority)
  4. admin.php - Admin dashboard (final)

NOT YET STARTED:
  [ ] convert_groups.php - Legacy tool

=============================================================================
NOTES FOR NEXT SESSION
=============================================================================

The manage_users redesign is complete and production-ready. All core
functionality works as expected. The form-based UI is much cleaner than
the modal-based approach, and the real-time assembly preview provides
excellent UX. The stale assembly management is comprehensive and helps
keep the system clean.

Key patterns used here (universal collapse handler, form population,
preview badges, etc.) can be reused in manage_site_config.php redesign.

System permissions management is now more robust with targeted subdirectory
checks that don't overwhelm admins with output. Only shows actual problems.

Assembly management in organism page now includes delete capability with
clear warnings about what's being deleted.

Search functionality across MOOP pages is now fully restored and tested.

=============================================================================
MANAGE_ANNOTATIONS - LATEST FIXES (Current Session)
=============================================================================

✅ FIXED EDIT DESCRIPTION BUTTON:
    - Problem: Current description not loading into modal
    - Root cause: Brittle DOM selector with quote escaping
    - Solution: Use closest() and find() to locate element within card
    - Result: Edit button now properly loads current description
    
✅ IMPROVED DB TYPE DISPLAY:
    - Problem: Types not in database shown confusingly
    - Solution: Check in_database flag from config
    - Display: Red "Not in DB" text instead of gray code
    - Helps admins identify orphaned annotation type entries

✅ COMMIT: 061a41c - Fix annotation page: DB Type display and edit description button
