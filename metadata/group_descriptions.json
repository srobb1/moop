These extraordinary creatures have evolved the unique ability to fly, with sizes ranging from the tiny 2-gram bumblebee bat, which has a wingspan of just 6 inches, to the impressive flying foxes, weighing up to 1.6 kilograms and spanning up to 5 feet 7 inches. This vast diversity in size, along with other fascinating phenotypic traits such as echolocation and specialized dietary habits, makes bats a compelling subject of study.",

These contributions not only support the natural world but also benefit humanity by enhancing agricultural productivity and reducing the need for pesticides. Beyond their ecological importance, bats hold significant cultural value worldwide. In many Eastern cultures, bats are revered as symbols of good fortune, happiness, and longevity, while in the West, they are often associated with mystery and the supernatural. Understanding these diverse cultural perspectives enriches our appreciation of bats and underscores their multifaceted significance.",

Their walls and the septa are indistinct. The skeleton is porous and there are small smooth surface projections known as verrucae which give the coral its common name of rice coral. These are irregularly spaced and may be fused near the tips of branches. The colour is normally pale brown with white verrucae.

Reptiles traditionally comprise four orders: Testudines (turtles), Crocodilia (crocodiles, alligators and gharials), Squamata (lizards and snakes) and Rhynchocephalia (tuatara), with about 12,000 extant species listed in the Reptile Database.[2] The study of the traditional reptile orders, customarily in combination with the study of modern amphibians, is called herpetology.\n\n",

Modern cladistic taxonomy regards that group as paraphyletic, since genetic and paleontological evidence has determined that birds (class Aves) are the only surviving group of Dinosauria, a major clade of diapsids that are more closely related to crocodilians than to other living reptiles, and thus birds are nested among reptiles (under the clade Archosauria) from a phylogenetic perspective. Many cladistic systems therefore redefine Reptilia as a clade (monophyletic group) including birds, though the precise definition of this clade varies between authors.[4][3] A similar concept is clade Sauropsida, which refers to all amniotes more closely related to modern reptiles than to mammals.[4]\n\n",

In particular, the Cretaceous\u2013Paleogene extinction event wiped out the pterosaurs, plesiosaurs, and all non-avian dinosaurs alongside many species of crocodyliforms and squamates (e.g., mosasaurs). Modern non-bird reptiles inhabit all the continents except Antarctica.\n\n",

As tetrapods, reptiles generally have four limbs or, in the case of snakes and legless lizards, are descended from four-limbed ancestors but have lost the limbs through evolution. Unlike the anamniotic amphibians, reptiles do not rely on waterbodies for reproduction and have no aquatic larval stage. Most reptiles are oviparous with shelled eggs, although several species of squamates are viviparous, as were some extinct marine reptile clades.[7] As amniotes, reptile eggs have extraembryonic membranes that retain water and facilitate biochemical exchange with the external environment, allowing reptiles to reproduce on dry land, even in extreme, arid habitats. Viviparous species have the eggs developing and hatching inside the mother's body, usually by internal incubation, although some species can nourish the eggs as fetuses through various forms of placenta analogs, with some providing initial parental care for their hatchlings.\n\n",
